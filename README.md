# GCHS-Band
In our website we set our colors to match the schools colors, our font to be easily visible to everyone, including the nearly blinde, our background to flow with the the rest of the website so nothing looks out of place, our reasoning (psychology) was to make the website fit everyones needs and to not affend anyone in any way by giving one certain group more credit than another.
